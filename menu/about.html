                This website was programmed by Luisa Lopes, a Computer Science major from Universidade Paulista (Unip).

                This was the first real project I've created in university, and I wanted to pay homage to my first ever website, which hosted "The Dying Detective" and included two special pages explaining about the main characters of said story (though it was a BIG piece of work, with little to no CSS and a lot of obsolete design choices). Footage of this website's predecessor does not exist, so you need to take my word for it when I say that 15 year old me really sucked at this.

                 The book "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" is composed of twelve different stories. Much like an anthology, the stories don't share that much connection with one another, other than the presence of the main characters; that is because it was the first collection of shortstories of the canon, a follow-up after the two initial novels. It was also on that book that many of the iconic characters of the Holmesian canon appeared for the first time, such as Irene Adler, alias "The Woman". Less well-known, but equally as interesting tales can be found within' these pages, such as the heist of the City and Suburnban Bank by the hands of John Clay and his partner, the perils of Miss Violet Hunter, and the only Christmas story as old as Dickens' ghosts, "The Blue Carbuncle".

            <p>
                All of these stories can be found here, all of them illustrated and all of them written with their original words. We hope you enjoyed your read, and the work that was put into developing the experience!
